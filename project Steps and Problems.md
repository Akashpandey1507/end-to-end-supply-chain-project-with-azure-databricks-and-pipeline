# High-Level Steps:

# Data Ingestion:
* Upload your datasets to Azure Data Lake Storage or Azure Blob Storage.
* Set up a data pipeline using Azure Data Factory or Azure Logic Apps to regularly fetch the data and ingest it into Azure Databricks.

# Data Preparation in Azure Databricks:
* Import and read the data into Azure Databricks using Spark.
* Perform data cleansing, transformation, and enrichment as needed.
* Store the prepared data in a structured format (e.g., Delta Lake).

# Data Analysis and Exploration:
* Use PySpark or Spark SQL to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Visualize the data using Databricks notebooks to gain insights into the datasets.

# Data Modeling:
* Create data models using Spark MLlib or other machine learning libraries if needed for predictive analysis.

# Data Visualization with Power BI:
* Connect Power BI to Azure Databricks to create data visualizations and dashboards.
* Build interactive reports and dashboards to provide insights into the data.

# Pipeline Orchestration:
* Set up an Azure Data Factory pipeline to automate data ingestion, transformation, and model retraining (if applicable).
* Schedule the pipeline to run at desired intervals.

# Access Control and Security:
* Ensure proper access controls and security measures are in place for both Azure Databricks and Power BI.

# Monitoring and Logging:
* Implement monitoring and logging for the data pipeline and data processing in Azure Databricks.

# Deployment and Automation:
* Automate the deployment of your Databricks notebooks and Power BI reports.
* Schedule report refreshes and pipeline runs.

# Documentation:
* Document the entire process, including data sources, transformations, models, and insights.



# Sample Analysis and Insights Questions:

# For the Sales Dataset:

1. What is the overall sales trend over time?
2. Which payment method (e.g., DEBIT, CASH, TRANSFER) is the most popular?
3. Are there any specific product categories that contribute significantly to sales?
4. Can you identify any correlations between "Days for shipping (real)" and "Late_delivery_risk"?
5. How does "Shipping Mode" affect customer satisfaction and sales?
6. What is the geographical distribution of customers, and does it impact sales or delivery status?

# For the Product Category Dataset:

1. What are the most popular product categories?
2. Is there a correlation between the month and the number of product views?
3. Which product categories have the highest click-through rates (CTR)?
4. Are there specific IP addresses associated with high engagement with certain product categories?
5 Are there any patterns in the time of day (hour) when products in a specific category are viewed?
